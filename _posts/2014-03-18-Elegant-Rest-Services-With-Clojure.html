<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">After spending some time in building Restful Web services with different frameworks and languages, i began to think that the Clojure solution is the most elegant and loosely coupled one. Instead of providing frameworks for handling everything, Clojure ecosystem has a bunch of libraries that you can put together, and along with the power of lisp, you can bend your rest services into DSL's for your application logic.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">I will walk you through a couple of code snippets to show you how i implement rest services.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">We will be using ring, compojure and http-kit to implement a clean, fast and elegant web service for building a simple pretty print service for edn files.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span> <script type="text/javascript" async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="9bf9a54090b201318cc522b59c6a013f" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/codemomentum/elegant-rest-services-with-clojure">https://speakerdeck.com/codemomentum/elegant-rest-services-with-clojure</a><br /><br />The source code is located at:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/codemomentum/clojurews">https://github.com/codemomentum/clojurews</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
