It is possible to create your first dsl-like structures in a few lines of code with Scala.<br /><br />I am working on a social graph, a simple one though. Some items are related to some other items in a certain way. Lets say, we have a relation called 'follows' between 2 items, and items are identified by unique strings:<br /><code><br /> 
{% gist 1357640 %}
 <br /></code>  <br />And the usage is as simple as:<br />
 <br /><code>"id1" follows "id2"</code><br />
 Have fun!
