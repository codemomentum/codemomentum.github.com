I patched the hadoop-lzo code from "github.com/kevinweil/hadoop-lzo" to be compatible with the Hadoop CDH4 release.<br />Unit tests are passing and also i did a quick functional test to check and i did not have any issues with input &amp; output formats.<br /><br />You can clone it here:<br />https://github.com/codemomentum/hadoop-lzo<br /><br />Let me know if you have issues...<br /><br />Cheers!
