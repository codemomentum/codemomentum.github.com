You can check out the sample Clojure webapp located here:<br /><br />https://github.com/Rcmmndr/rcmmndr-clojure-sample<br /><br />Its a sample for Rcmmndr.com integration but you can strip out that part and use it for a template as you wish.<br /><br />Its using &nbsp;compojure and clostache..<br /><br /><br />
